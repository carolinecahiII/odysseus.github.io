the softness of her breast seems to absorb you like a snowbank, pulling you in futher and further until you feel yourself enter a separate place altogether...

<img src="images/evans.png">

everything around you snaps to blackness, as if someone has dropped a heavy curtain on your head. you're somewhere else. a metallic ringing begins somewhere far away, growing slowly to an ear splitting pitch.

you clap your hands to your ears, shut your eyes with all your strength and call out to god. 

<em>jesus save me. jesus save me from this place. thought i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall not fear</em>

when you open your eyes, evans is there. sitting across from you in the blackness. his hollowed, once round face aligned with yours but looking at nothing in particular. 

you notice his hands and nose are black as coal. the back of his head covered in dried blood.

"you left me, ted. left me to die." his mouth doesn't move but the words emerge from somewhere, the sound like rusted gears grinding.

you see yourself in the hut, as if a thousand years ago. it's warm and aglow with a thousand kerosene lamps.

the smell of sacred baconfat hangs in the air. there are plates of cornmeal bread and thick slices of bacon to go with them. hot tea and whiskey mingle together in steaming tankards. 

men raise their voices in merriment and sing as card games are played and lost and lewd jokes are exchanged. cherry, barely a whisker on his face, laughs and it feels like the walls will collapse with his joy. 

osman, a handsome and loyal Siberian husky who will outlive you by nearly five years, curls at your feet, contently gnawing on a seal bone.

scott, perched in a chair near his quarters, regards the scene with a peaceful grin and chews on his pipestem. 

you are conquerers at the edge of the world. immortal frontiersmen. fools doomed to die.

you watch scott scribble into his diary, humming tunelessly. your party reached the south pole days ago, only to find a norwegian flag snapping in the wind. amundsen's team had beat you to it. all this death for nothing. something in scott had changed then, he had taken on this sickly sweet positivity you knew would be your end.

scott rises in silence and snaps to attention. 

"alright boys, it's a brand new day," he exclaims, an artificial enthusiam bellowing out from his barrel chest. you and bowers regard him with as much loyalty as you can muster.

"birdie, see to oates and collect a bit of snow for water, we're drinking like camels it seems.

you jump in place, shaking your limbs in some childlike attempt to regain control of your body, you mind, or whatever else is plaguing you.

before you, the sled supplies are stacked haphazardly. scott wants you to reorganize them to alleviate weight issues during your next trek. 

the wind whips you hood back and you notice the clouds above you are forming just as they did before the last storm.

then, all of a sudden, it's quiet. 

you turn your gaze to the light above and marvel. the aurora borealis weaves across the polar sky like a ballerina...

you hear evan's voice, soft now, in the quiet of your mind.

"you need only take it, ted. take it and leave this place. come see me."

you place the cut onto the end of your knife and hold it briefly over the small kerosene flame in the center of the tent until its edges are seared.

when you pull back the canvas door, you face Oates, up and out of bed. his eyes are rheumy white, his skin like bone. he's in just his wool underlayers and his fisherman's hat.

behind him, bowers and scott look just as confused as you are.

bowers grabs your shoulders. "it had to be done, ed. i'm glad it was you. poor bastard lost his mind. we'd die out here if he kept going."

<em>17 march, 1912. ross ice shelf, antarctica.</em>

the fog of dreaming lifts and your circumstances reoccur to you. with consciousness comes the return of gnawing, desperate, white hot hunger.

the cold sun, a million miles away, is bright enough to light the tent despite the tempest outside. antarctic wind rips relentlessly against your shelter's canvas walls, begging to be let in. begging to swallow you like it swallows everything. 

like it swallowed evans.

beside you, captain scott stirs just enought to creak the wood frame of his cot. you consider waking him. sleep is rare, sacred even, and the only respite from your shared circumstances for the forseeable future.

your wife was -- is -- incredibly beautiful, unusually tall, disarmingly intelligent, and altogether absolutely singular. she was a naturalist herself. 

she would love it here. well, under better circumstances.

though your gaze is fixed on the wasteland, you can see her sitting in your shared kitchen, patiently stripping the buds from a bushel of yarrow. she'll boil them in linseed oil and make a wonderful topical solution to rub on your inevitably achey hands, tired from writing reports.

a ribbon of chestnut curls runs down the nape of her neck onto her chest, and she brushes it away gently. you watch her eyes, like light on a lake, flick from task to task with razor focus.

in the memory, you watch yourself walk into the room and behind her, kissing her head gently. 

"how are you, mrs. bill?" you inquire. she laughs, that windchime laugh.

you also know there's no way you're making it to that depot alive, pack or not.

you see bowers, to your right, dutifully getting to work on his task. his shaking hands, red and rough, struggle to button his overcoat.

you decide you'd rather die in your sleeping bag than frozen upright in the pale, scientist's soft hands gripping rough rope.

"sir, maybe it's better if we wait for the storm to pass. visibility is low and oates cannot travel in this state."

scott clicks his tongue. "not to worry, my friend. we're close, I know it. we just need to push over this ledge, and we won't get there unless our supplies are moveable. out you go."

background
<hr>

ODYSSEUS is a CYOA game. you play as Edward 'Uncle Bill' or 'Ted" Wilson, an ornithologist, naturalist, and physician. the other two crewmen are henry roberts 'birdie' bowers and lawrence 'titus' oates. you are part of Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's final expedition to the south pole, where all five men involved lost their lives.

rules
<hr>

this game uses a dice roll mechanic to determine whether certain actions are or are not successful. 

when the player attempts certain actions, a 20 sided dice is rolled and the result of the roll spells the success or failure of the action.

for example, if the player chooses to lift something heavy:
<ul>
		<li>a roll of 1 would mean the character drops the item. </li>
    	<li>a roll of 20 means the item is lifted with ease.</li>
        <li>a roll in the middle means either middling success or failure depending on the task.</li>
</ul>
the number required to succeed on an action will not be visible to the player.

times in this story where a dice roll determines a result are marked by links in <div style="color: goldenrod">ALL CAPS.</div>

scott packs his pipe with tobacco and places it in his mouth, unlit.

"a bit of rest, boys. while we wait for the storm to pass."

on your elbows with shallow breaths to keep a pair of binoculars steady. a kestrel appears, fussing with the branches of the lone dead cedar. with one soft hand, you scribble its likeness into your field notebook.

abandoned in the unforgiving white expanse. the wind carried his agonized cries for what seemed like miles.

you rise from your cot and press a hand to oates' back several times, seemingly with no effect. his eyes are pressed tightly together and he fusses, mumbling to himself.

lifting his covers slightly you see that oates is soaked in sweat, bone white, and radiating a sickly heat. he's in the late stages of scurvy, the old devil that haunts all of you now. 

as the expedition's surgeon, you know there are few treatments for such an advanced state. fresh seal meat, rich with vitamins and fat, seemed to help some. you know there's only a few scant pounds left in your supply pack.

when you reach to wake up scott, you see he's already awake and scrawling in his diary. he catches your glance and bowers', and readies himself to give today's assignments.

oates stares straight ahead, through you. 

'i am....i am just going outside, and may be some time.' 

the wind picks up, and you feel new sheets of snow start to fall around you at speed. 
oates clasps your shoulder, squeezes it, never dropping his vacant stare.

"let him go, bill." scott says from inside the tent.

you step aside and oates walks into the white vastness of an antarctic snowstorm in a single layer of clothing. 


history will call him a brave man, indeed.
